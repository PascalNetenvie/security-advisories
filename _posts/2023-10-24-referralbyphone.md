In the module "Referral and Affiliation Program" (referralbyphone) up to 3.5.1 (all versions - see WARNING) from Snegurka for PrestaShop, a guest can perform SQL injection in affected versions.


## Summary

* **CVE ID**: [CVE-2023-46358](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46358)
* **Published at**: 2023-10-24
* **Platform**: PrestaShop
* **Product**: referralbyphone
* **Impacted release**: <= 3.5.1 (WARNING : The author has not fixed the vulnerability)
* **Product author**: Snegurka
* **Weakness**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
* **Severity**: critical (9.8)

## Description

Method `ReferralByPhoneDefaultModuleFrontController::ajaxProcessCartRuleValidate` has sensitive SQL calls that can be executed with a trivial http call and exploited to forge a SQL injection.

**WARNING** : This exploit is actively used to deploy a webskimmer to massively steal credit cards.

This exploit uses a PrestaShop front controller and most attackers can conceal the module controller's path during the exploit, so you will never know within your conventional frontend logs that it exploits this vulnerability. **You will only see "POST /" inside your conventional frontend logs.** Activating the AuditEngine of mod_security (or similar) is the only way to get data to confirm this exploit.

## CVSS base metrics

* **Attack vector**: network
* **Attack complexity**: low
* **Privilege required**: none
* **User interaction**: none
* **Scope**: unchanged
* **Confidentiality**: high
* **Integrity**: high
* **Availability**: high

**Vector string**: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Possible malicious usage

* Obtain admin access
* Remove data from the associated PrestaShop
* Copy/paste data from sensitive tables to FRONT to expose tokens and unlock admins's ajax scripts
* Rewrite SMTP settings to hijack emails


## Proof of concept

```bash
curl -v -d 'fc=modulemodule=referralbyphone&controller=default&action=CartRuleValidate&ws_voucher=%27;select+0x73656C65637420736C656570283432293B+into+@a;prepare+b+from+@a;execute+b;--' 'https://preprod.X'
```


## Patch from 3.5.1

```diff
--- 3.5.1/modules/referralbyphone/controllers/front/default.php
+++ XXXXX/modules/referralbyphone/controllers/front/default.php
        $id_ws_sponsor = Db::getInstance(_PS_USE_SQL_SLAVE_)->getValue(
-           'SELECT `id_ws_sponsor` FROM `' . _DB_PREFIX_ . 'ws_ref_coupon_rule` WHERE `code` = \'' . $ws_voucher . '\''
+           'SELECT `id_ws_sponsor` FROM `' . _DB_PREFIX_ . 'ws_ref_coupon_rule` WHERE `code` = \'' . pSQL($ws_voucher) . '\''
        );
```

## Other recommendations

* It’s recommended to delete the module since author no longer maintain it.
* Upgrade PrestaShop to the latest version to disable multiquery executions (separated by “;”) - be warned that this functionality **WILL NOT** protect your SHOP against injection SQL which uses the UNION clause to steal data.
* Change the default database prefix `ps_` with a new longer, arbitrary prefix. Nevertheless, be warned that this is useless against blackhats with DBA senior skills because of a design vulnerability in DBMS
* Activate OWASP 942's rules on your WAF (Web application firewall), be warned that you will probably break your backoffice and you will need to pre-configure some bypasses against this set of rules.
